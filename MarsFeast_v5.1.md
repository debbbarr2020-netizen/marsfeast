Plain-language summary of MarsFeast_v5.1:

This file summarizes the new MarsFeast v5.1 design notes. The commit adds a 26-line spec describing a closed-loop Mars settlement system that produces propellant and food at scale.

Key points:
- New file created: MarsFeast_v5.1 describes a plan to produce 1,500 t of methalox per Starship tank and supply 1,000 full Starship tank loads per year, enabling high-frequency population rotation without Earth resupply.
- System-level claims: a quad-loop with ~98% recycling efficiency across nutrients, water, gases, and waste; subsystem gains of +15% methane yield and +20% O2 from soil/electrolysis improvements; Block 2 tanks increased capacity by ~25%.
- Four integrated "Legs":
  1) Feeding Frenzy — high-efficiency agriculture (hydro/aero towers, LED lighting, engineered algae and crops) targeting 2,500 kcal/person/day and near-complete O2 recycling.
  2) Waste Waltz — anaerobic digesters and composting (UASB, methanogens, vermiculture, biochar) converting effluent into energy and fertilizer, boosting CH4 for fuel production.
  3) Soil Seduction — microbial and fungal treatments to detoxify perchlorate, build fertile soil, and increase oxygen production for fuel/electrolysis.
  4) Fuel Fox-Trot — Sabatier reactors plus electrolysis to convert CO2 and water into methane and oxygen, supported by high-power (perovskite) generation and larger cryotanks for orbital refueling.
- Economic/timeline claims: asserted $12 trillion savings per decade (split into supply-chain and fuel savings), Mojave pod live Nov '25 and "1M Q1 '26" timeline, and rapid breakeven for propellant production ("1.5 sols" referenced in text).
- Tone and caveats: the document uses informal, hyperbolic language and makes aggressive technical and economic claims that should be validated with detailed engineering analysis.
